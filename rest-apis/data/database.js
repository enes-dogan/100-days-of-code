  The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.
  Remember that very little is needed to make a happy life.
  You have power over your mind â€“ not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.
  Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.
  First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.
  He who laughs at himself never runs out of things to laugh at.
